# Macroeconomic Researcher Food Security Time Series and Large Language Chat GPT Dashboard

## Introduction

This dashboard provides an interactive tool for researchers focusing on food security and macroeconomic indicators. It integrates time series data and large language model (LLM) capabilities to analyze trends in GDP, agricultural output, debt, imports, and other critical indicators related to food security. Leveraging data from sources like the FAO and World Bank, the dashboard serves as a comprehensive resource for examining the economic and agricultural factors impacting global food security.
